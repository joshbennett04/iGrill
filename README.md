# iGrill
C# Library to connect to the iGrill using Microsoft's Gatt Libraries
Requires the Windows 10 Creators update. I have interfaced this with my own bbq smoker touch screen control module, as well as mobile apps.
This allows me to utilize the readings from several devices. I can hook up a raspberry pi to my tv and monitor the iGrill from there.
